A Trainer class for training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically designed to handle image-to-imag translation tasks. This class encapsulates the setup, training, and saving functionalities for both generator and discriminator models within the GAN architecture.

### Method: Train Discriminator

This method is responsible for training the discriminator model by using both real and fake data batches. It computes the loss for real and generated images separately and then updates the discriminator's weights based on these losses.

#### Parameters

| Parameter  | Type | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `**kwargs` | dict | Keyword arguments containing 'realA' and 'realB', the input and target images for the discriminator. |

#### Returns

| Return | Type         | Description                                                                      |
| ------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loss` | torch.Tensor | The total loss for the discriminator after processing both real and fake images. |

#### Notes

- This method is designed to be called within the main training loop in the `train` method. Its primary function is to facilitate the discriminator's learning process by distinguishing between real images (actual data) and fake images (generated by the generator model). The loss calculated reflects the discriminator's performance in correctly identifying real and fake images, which is crucial for adjusting its weights through backpropagation during training.

### Method: Train Generator

This method is responsible for training the discriminator model by using both real and fake data batches. It computes the loss for real and generated images separately and then updates the generator's weights based on these losses.

#### Parameters

| Parameter  | Type | Description                                                                                      |
| ---------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `**kwargs` | dict | Keyword arguments containing 'realA' and 'realB', the input and target images for the generator. |

#### Returns

| Return | Type         | Description                                                                  |
